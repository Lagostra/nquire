                    <p>Welcome to <em>nquire!</em> This product is one
                    of the leading innovations in the field of
                    university level teaching. We, the<em>nquire</em>-team,
                    envision every lecture to be an interactive discussion
                    between students and professor. With this tool, lectures
                    will improved through iteration, based on feedback from
                    the students.</p>

                <h2>Difficulty.</h2>
                <p>Through <em>nquire's</em> dynamic presentation viewer, students
                    can easily browse slides during a lecture. The users can, at
                    their own pace, mark whichever parts of the slides they find
                    challenging, so the lecturer knows what might need further
                    explannation.

                <h2>Questions?</h2>
                <p>Do your students have questions during the leture?
                    By using <em>nquire's</em> asking-feature, the students
                    can ask questions without raising their hands and
                    grabbing everyone's attention. As a lecturer you can
                    browse the questions and answer them at your own pace,
                    making for an interactive lecture.

                <p>Do you sometimes talk too slowly? Or maybe you just wonder
                    whether your students can keep up? With <em>nquire</em>
                    you can easily and dynamically get pace feedback from the
                    students, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments!
